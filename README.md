# Facial Recognition for Access Control

## Overview
This project implements a facial recognition system for access control using deep learning techniques. It includes scripts for data collection, preprocessing, model training, and real-time recognition.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FacialRecognition.git
   cd FacialRecognition


### Explanation of the Usage Section

- run command python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


- **Data Collection**: Explain where to place the collected images and specify the naming convention.
- **Preprocessing**: Provide instructions on how to preprocess the collected data using the `preprocess_data.py` script.
- **Training**: Describe how to train the facial recognition model using the `train_model.py` script.
- **Real-Time Recognition**: Steps to run and interact with the real-time recognition script (`real_time_recognition.py`), including how to exit the application.

By including this usage section, users will have clear instructions on how to utilize your facial recognition system from data collection to real-time recognition. Adjust the instructions based on any specific configurations or requirements your project may have.
